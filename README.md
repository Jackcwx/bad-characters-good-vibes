## Building Blocks

### 1. Our user stories

#### MVP

1. As a user I want to see a page with two random characters and be able to click on a vote for which character is more evil/good
2. As a user I want to see a page of a random individidual character
3. As a user I want to see a page an individidual character when I select them
4. As a user I want to see a page all of the characters belonging to a manager
5. As a user I want to be able to sign in as a manager
6. As a user I want to see a page displaying all the top 5 most good/evil/neutral characters
7. As a manager I want to be able to create a new character and input their name and bio

#### MVP +

1. As a user on the main page I want to choose either a good or evil character based on the random question asked
2. As a user I want to see an interesting 404 page that references the current day
3. As a manager I want to be able to delete my characters
4. As a manager I want to be able to upload an image of my character as I create them
5. As a manager I want to be able to register with account details

#### Stretch

1. As a user I want to be able to see comments and comment on characters
2. As a user I want to generate a character with an AI and see it in the character rotation
3. As a manager I want to be able to search for images from an image API with a search box
